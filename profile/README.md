# Well Walt Studios 💡✨

**Building apps that build people.**

Welcome to **Well Walt Studios**, a tech studio dedicated to creating software that empowers people to live better, smarter, and more intentional lives. From productivity tools to lifestyle apps, we design technology that works with you—not against you.

## 🚀 What We Do
- **Productivity Apps**: Tools that help people track habits, routines, and milestones (e.g., [Aurova](https://wellwaltstudios.com) — our flagship habit & mood tracking app, launching October 2025).  
- **Custom Software Development**: Web & mobile development for small businesses and startups.  
- **Tech Consulting**: Fractional CTO support, audits, and guidance on product strategy & system design.  
- **Maintenance & Support**: Helping businesses keep their products reliable and scalable.

## 🌟 Our Philosophy
At Well Walt Studios, we believe tech should:
- **Simplify, not overwhelm**  
- **Empower, not distract**  
- **Support growth** — personal, professional, and communal  

We don’t just build features—we build systems that help people transform their lives.
